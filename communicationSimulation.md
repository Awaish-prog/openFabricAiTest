# Discussion to explain a technical issue to a non-technical stakeholder.

**Non-Technical Stakeholder**: Hey, I heard there's an issue with one of the test cases. Can you give me an update?

**Technical Team Member (TTM)**: Absolutely. We've identified a problem with a specific test case that's designed to check if our AI app properly handles empty prompts. Currently, the test is failing, and it's not showing the expected error message when the user clicks the "Run" button with an empty prompt.

**Non-Technical Stakeholder**: Okay, what does that mean for the app?

**TTM**: It means that if a user forgets to input a prompt and tries to generate an image, the app should ideally display an error message saying, "Prompt can't be empty." This is to guide users and ensure they provide a prompt before running the application. However, the error message isn't appearing as expected, and that's what we're investigating.

**Non-Technical Stakeholder**: Why is this a concern? Can't we just fix it?

**TTM**: Absolutely, and that's what we're working on. The concern is that if the app allows users to proceed without a prompt, it might lead to unexpected behavior or inaccurate image generation. It's crucial for the app to provide clear guidance and enforce the requirement of entering a prompt for accurate results.

**Non-Technical Stakeholder**: So, what's the plan to fix this?

**TTM**: We're currently in the process of systematically diagnosing the issue. We're reviewing the code that handles empty prompts, checking our test case implementation, and ensuring our testing environment is set up correctly. We've added log statements and are using debugging tools to trace the flow of execution. Once we identify the root cause, we'll update the code to ensure the app behaves as expected.

**Non-Technical Stakeholder**: How soon can we expect a resolution?

**TTM**: We're working on it as a priority. Once we pinpoint the problem and make the necessary changes, we'll run thorough tests to ensure everything is back on track. I'll keep you updated on our progress, and we'll aim to resolve this as quickly as possible to maintain the app's reliability.

**Non-Technical Stakeholder**: Thanks for the update. Let me know if there's anything I can do to support the process.

**TTM**: Absolutely, and I appreciate your understanding. I'll keep you posted on our progress and reach out if we need any additional assistance.
