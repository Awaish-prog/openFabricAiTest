# Test case resolution

## Empty prompt test case resolution

### 1. Review Code and Documentation:

* Examine the code related to the test case and the function responsible for handling empty prompts.
* Check the documentation to ensure that the expected behavior for empty prompts is well-defined.

### 2. Inspect Test Implementation:

* Review the test case implementation to confirm that it accurately reflects the requirements and expected behavior.
* Verify that the test case explicitly checks for an empty prompt and expects an error message.

### 3. Check Dependencies:

* Ensure that the test environment, including dependencies and configurations, is set up correctly.
* Verify that there are no external factors influencing the test, such as network issues or external services.

### 4. Logging and Debugging:

* Introduce logging statements to output relevant information during test execution.
* Use debugging tools to step through the code and identify any unexpected behavior.
* Inspect the error messages or exceptions thrown during the test.

### 5. Test Data and State:

* Confirm that the test case starts with a clean and consistent state.
* Verify that no previous tests or external factors leave the system in an unexpected state that affects the current test.

### 6. Review Test Framework:

* Check the test framework's documentation for any peculiarities or known issues related to error handling or assertion failures.
* Ensure that the framework is up to date.

### 7. Collaborate with Team:

* Discuss the issue with team members to gather insights.
* If there have been recent changes to the codebase, identify if they might be contributing to the failure.

### 8. Update Test Case or Code:

* If the test case is incorrect, update it to accurately reflect the expected behavior.
* If the code is incorrect, make the necessary changes to handle empty prompts correctly.

### 9. Re-run and Monitor:

* After making changes, re-run the test case and monitor the results.
* Ensure that the error message is displayed correctly for empty prompts.

### 10. Regression Testing:

* After fixing the issue, perform regression testing to ensure that other functionalities are not affected.

### 12. Documentation Update:

* If you identify any discrepancies between the code, test case, and documentation, update them accordingly.
